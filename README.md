##### What Language Is This?
The code you pasted is written using three web technologies:

# 1.HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
    This defines the structure of the web page:
         Example: <div>, <h1>, <button> are HTML tags.

# 2.CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
      This controls the design and styling of the page.
          Example: background colors, fonts, button styles.

# 3.JavaScript (JS)
    This adds logic and interactivity.
       Example: showing questions, checking answers, updating score.

Together, these three are the core languages of web development.

 ## How Does It Run?
    **You don’t need any special compiler.**
    **Just save the code in a file with the extension .html (for example: quiz.html).**
    **Double-click the file or open it in any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).**
    **The browser itself understands HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so it will render the page and run the quiz logic.**

## What Happens When You Run It?
     **HTML builds the quiz container (title, question area, options area, score area).**
     **CSS makes it look nice (gradient background, rounded buttons, hover effects).**
     **JavaScript loads questions one by one, creates option buttons dynamically, checks if your answer is correct, and finally shows your score.**
# Summary:
    **Language used: HTML + CSS + JavaScript**
    **Execution: Runs directly in a web browser (no extra software needed)** 
    

Output: A fully interactive quiz game with questions, options, and scoring
